This project is a web page that lists events in Sydney, Australia, by scraping event websites. The page updates daily, displays event details attractively, and includes a 'GET TICKETS' button that collects email addresses before redirecting users to the original ticket site.

## Features

    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Set up environment variables in a `.env` file:
    ```ini
    DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
    SCRAPING_SCHEDULE="0 0 * * *"  # Runs daily at midnight
    ```
4. Run database migrations (if using PostgreSQL):
